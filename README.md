# ChatMessenger
a NodeJS based Messenger using the [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) framework to make things easier for me.  
  
If you see any problems or have ideas how to make it better, feel free to create an [issue with the Feature Request](https://github.com/chibbi/ChatMessenger/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=%5BFEATURE%5D+). I would love to read your ideas and improve.

I am thinking about rewriting it in deno, but probably not, because this would run on a rpi which does not yet have deno runtime.
